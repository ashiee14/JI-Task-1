Java Internship Task 1

Work done:
1.Downloaded and installed OpenJDK from the official OpenJDK source and properly configure the JAVA_HOME environment variable to ensure Java commands work globally across the system.\n
2.Verified Java installation by running java -version and javac -version commands to confirm both runtime and compiler are functioning correctly.
3.Created a new directory structure manually to understand how Java projects are organized at a basic filesystem level.
4.Wrote a simple Java class using a text editor and define a main() method following correct Java syntax rules.
5.Compiled the Java file using the javac compiler and understand how .class bytecode is generated.
6.Executed the compiled program using the java command and observe output in the terminal.
7.Modified the program to accept command-line arguments and print them, reinforcing how Java applications receive runtime input.
8.Introduced basic comments and formatting standards to align with professional coding practices.

Deliverables:
Compiled and executed Java program - uploaded .class and .java files
Screenshot or log of terminal execution - uploaded screenshot
Source code file with comments - uploaded .java file
